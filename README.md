# Azul

Implementation of the Azul board game as an environment for training RL agents.

## Development

The easiest way to develop is to reuse the setup created for running the project in GitPod:

1. Create an account in GitPod if you don't have one
2. Ask the project owner to set you as a collaborator on this project on GitHub
3. Go to GitPod Settings > Integrations > GitHub > Edit Permissions > set public_repo to True
4. Create a GitPod [workspace](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) pointing to this repo
5. The provisioned Docker should have everything installed

## How to run

Run this from the `azul` directory:

```bash
cargo run
```
