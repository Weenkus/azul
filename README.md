# Azul

Implementation of the Azul board game as an environment for training RL agents.

## Development

The easiest way to develop is to reuse all the setup created for running it in GitPod, to be exact

1. Create an account in GitPod if you don't have one
2. Create a [workspace](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) pointing to this repo
3. The provisioned docker should have everything installed

## How to run

Run this frm the `azul` directory:

```bash
cargo run
```
